    abstract = {Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications.In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.Bradford Books imprint},

 abstract = {Although simple random sampling is the standard sampling procedure in Monte Carlo simulation, such practice is questioned in this paper. In any Monte Carlo application, sampled distributions are assumed to be known. Using simple random sampling, sample histograms or, equivalently, sample moments will vary at random, thus producing an imprecise description of the known input distribution, and consequently increasing the variance of simulation estimates. This problem can be avoided with descriptive sampling, here proposed as a more appropriate approach in Monte Carlo simulation than simple random sampling. Descriptive sampling is based on a deterministic and purposive selection of the sample values-in order to conform as closely as possible to the sampled distribution-and the random permutation of these values. As such, it represents a fundamental conceptual change in Monte Carlo sampling, departing from the `principle' that sample values must be randomly generated in order to describe random behaviour. The basis of this new idea, examples of its use and empirical results are presented.},

 abstract = {The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum. A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however.},

abstract = {A solution construction method and a tabu search improvement heuristic coupled with the deviation concept found in deterministic annealing is developed to solve the truck and trailer routing problem. We test our tabu search method on 21 problems that have been converted from the basic vehicle routing problem. Our construction method always solves a problem (it always finds a feasible solution) and the tabu search improvement heuristic significantly improves an initial solution.
Scope and purpose
The vehicle routing problem holds a central place in distribution management and logistics, and its practical significance has been well documented in the literature. The truck and trailer routing problem is a variant of the vehicle routing problem to take into account some real-life applications in which fleet of mk trucks and ml trailers (mkâ©¾ml) services a set of customers. Some customers can be serviced by a complete vehicle (that is, a truck pulling a trailer) or by a truck alone, whereas others can be serviced only a truck alone. There are three types of routes in a solution to the problem: (1) a pure truck route traveled by a truck alone, (2) a pure vehicle route without any sub-tours traveled by a complete vehicle, and (3) a complete vehicle route consisting of a main tour traveled by a complete vehicle, and one or more sub-tours traveled by a truck alone. A sub-tour begins and finishes at a customer on the main tour where the truck uncouples, parks, and re-couples its pulling trailer and continues to service the remaining customers on the sub-tour. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled, or total cost incurred by the fleet. The problem is more difficult to solve than the basic vehicle routing problem, but it occurs in many real-life applications. The purpose of this article is to develop a solution method that generates an initial solution and improves the solution using tabu search. The tabu search procedure uses the deviation concept found in deterministic annealing to further improve the initial solution. Our heuristic solves the truck and trailer routing problem efficiently and effectively.}
